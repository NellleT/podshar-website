/**
 * Podshar's face: the pug in a hood.
 *
 * Deliberately a plain `<img>` rather than `next/image`. The file is one small
 * fixed-size asset rendered at 28–56px, so the optimiser has nothing to win,
 * and `onError` — the whole point here — is straightforward on a raw element.
 *
 * If the file is missing or fails to decode, the component falls back to the
 * stroke mark, so a bad deploy loses the joke rather than the interface.
 *
 * The source file is already cropped square and tight on the head (see
 * public/assets/README.md), so `object-center` is correct here — an offset
 * anchor would now push the face off its own circle.
