/**
 * The "ПХ" reactor.
 *
 * A warning light: a small solid red core, a tight halo, and twelve rays
 * reaching in toward it. The joke is that it looks consequential and does
 * nothing at all — press it and it just gets ruder.
 *
 * A pointer anywhere on the page drives two signals:
 *
 *   proximity   1 at the core, 0 at FALLOFF px away. Squared, so the reactor
 *               stays dim across the room and lights up late as the cursor
 *               closes in, instead of glowing faintly the entire time.
 *
 *   bearing     `Math.atan2` gives the exact angle to the cursor. It moves the
 *               halo's centre a clamped distance that way and slides the whole
 *               ray ring after it, so the light leans toward the pointer.
 *
 * The light is two parts that barely talk to each other. The fill is a small
 * quiet halo that only has to bridge core and vines. The vines are the show:
 * SVG curves that grow toward the pointer and curl around it, drawn by
 * `ReactorVines`. They are deliberately not derived from the fill — a gradient
 * cannot bend, and bending is the entire idea.
 *
 * The core and the label never move. Only the light does — and on a press it
 * moves outward: two rings swell out of the core while a decaying `punch` value
 * lifts the whole field, so the vines flex with the wave rather than watching
 * it go past.
 *
 * Everything runs through motion values, so the gradients are rewritten on the
 * elements directly and React never re-renders during a mouse move. The press
 * counter is the one piece of real state, and it only changes on click.
 *
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` parks the aura at a fixed intensity, drops the idle
 * breath and the turn, and never attaches the listener.
